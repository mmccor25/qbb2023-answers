1.1 
	1,000,000 bp * 3 / 100 = 30,000 reads

1.3
	In the simulation, there are 52786 bases with zero coverage. This is 5.2786% of the genome.
	The histogram somewhat fits both distributions, and it appears to match the normal distribution better than Poisson.

1.4
	In the simulation, there are 23 bases with zero coverage. This is 0.0023% of the genome.
	The histogram fits both distributions well, and the normal distribution the best.

1.5 
	In the simulation, there are 7 bases with zero coverage. This is 0.0007% of the genome.
	The histogram fits both distributions excellently.

	We would need to know which 3-mer starts off the sequence and how many iterations of each loop there are. A reference genome would help.
