2.2
	1. Size: The slope coefficient is 0.3776. This means that every year older the mother is, the rate of maternal de novo mutations tends to increase by 0.3776. The y-intercept, 2.5, is the number you would add to (.3776 * maternal age) to make a prediction of dnms based on maternal age (or hypothetically, how many dnms would result from a zero-year old mother lol)
	
	This matches the plot, because there seems to be a gradual upward trend in dnms with age.


	2. This relationship is statistically significant because the p value is very small (less than .001)

2.3 
	1. Size: the slope coefficient is 1.3538. This means that every year older the father is, the rate of paternal de novo mutations tends to increase by 1.3538
	This matches the plot, because there seems to be a gradual upward trend in dnms with age, but with a sharper increase than the maternal graph.



2.4
	y = mx + b
	dnm = (1.3538)(age) + 10.3263
	dnm = (1.3538)(50.1) + 10.3263
	dnm = 78.15168

2.6
	1. I chose a paired t-test because we are comparing two numbers, and the maternal and paternal dnms must both correspond to the same proband.

	2. Yes, they are significantly different because the p-value is much smaller than .001
